# pytorch-MemNet
pytorch reimplementation of basic architecture of [MemNet](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Tai_MemNet_A_Persistent_ICCV_2017_paper.pdfï¼‰

In terms of my own experience, this module achieves better performance than several image restoration deep architectures (e.g. VDSR, DnCNN, e.t.c.). But it does not follow the original implementation by authors, so try it for your own risks.
